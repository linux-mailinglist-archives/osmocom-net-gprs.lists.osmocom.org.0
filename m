Dear fellow Osmocom developers,

more than a month later and the world is a completely different place once
again.

Given that the number of daily infections and deaths are again rising in
Germany, I am rather happy that we didn't settle for a spring date in / around
our usual April time frame.

the poll has shown a clear preference for September.  So if we are to hold
an OsmoDevCon this year, it will definitely be in September.

I haven't really seen much feedback on that topic.  I still like that idea,
and the limited feedback I've seen was positive / neutral, so I think I'll
continue to explore in that direction.

Regards,
