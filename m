Agree, I consider this a must (or some sort of equivalent certificate).

I'd say at least providing a PCR/antigen test over last 24-48h is 
enough, given that I expect no much social interaction with third 
parties once OsmoDevCon starts, since we'll be most part of the day 
together. That'd be fine for me. Maybe one can be enforced during the 
first day at start of the event.

While in general I like being at IN Berlin during the conferences, it 
would be a good idea to explore other venues for this year, were we can 
have a bit more space between people and a bigger volume of ventilated 
air, maybe also with some extra place outside.

The specific rules regarding this topic can probably be 
discussed/announced a few days/weeks before the event, to take into 
account current legislation, epidemic numbers, etc. since it doesn't 
involve any kind of organization ahead.

Pau
